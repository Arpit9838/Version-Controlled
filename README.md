# Version-Controlled DevOps Project

##  Overview
This project is a  example to practice Git & GitHub version control best practices.  
The goal is to implement a proper branching workflow (main â†’ dev â†’ feature) and document the development process.

---

##  Tools Used
- Git â€“ For version control.
- GitHub â€“ For remote repository hosting.
- Markdown â€“ For documentation.

---

##  Branching Workflow
1. main â€“ Stable production-ready code.
2. dev â€“ Integration branch for testing features before merging to main.
3. feature/ â€“ Temporary branches for developing specific features.
